## Generic .APK file for an App that connects to a cheap Drone build

<tt> this repo consists of an app from the google play store. 
     I first transferred the .apk to my linux desktop and then used 
     the 'apktool' to crack it open and have a look. initially I 
     was only interested in changing some of the Chinese characters
     to English. then I realized I had been over looking the option
     in the settings. </tt><br>


<tt> None the less, after I started diving into the architexture of 
     the filesystem I became more and more curious as to what else can be 
     hacked or modded with this cheap little drone. Next I intend to take a stab 
     at dumping the firmware on the actual device and upgrading the power 
     system for greater time in the air. </tt><br>

<tt> Any ideas or recommendations are welcome. I will include more 
     details about the actual craft and manufacturer as soon as possible.
     Ill say this... it is one of the cheapest models of functional
     drones that one can purchase and still fly. The battery life is about 15 
     minutes flying at 30% power. 12 minutes for flying at 60% power and
     I've yet to time flight while operating at 100% In general this 
     is just a product to nerd out on while it s cold outside. </tt>

 <tt> Just as an update... As of the first of 2025 I am still updaating and putting together 
      the entirety of the apk file while also dissecting it and learning what I can 
      from it along the way. Once you get down in there you can see how and where the information 
      for the adds comes and goes through. Its interesting. I intend to keep pursuind this
      project as I can. I also testes and esp-8266 deauther against the network ssid that
      the drone hosts in order for the mobile device to connect.</tt>
